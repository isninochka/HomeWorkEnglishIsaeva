Why should we hire you?

I don't have enough programming experience yet, but I worked for a large company and am very motivated
to develop further with your company and gain new knowledge.

What are your strengths?

I approach my work responsibly, always keep deadlines, listen to feedback and draw conclusions. 
My sociability allows me to work well in a team. I also believe that if you don't know something, 
you can always learn it. Even bears can ride a bicycle, which means that nothing is impossible for a person.

Can you share a weakness? 

Perhaps you will think that I am my weakness, it is that I have two children. But I will tell you that this 
is not the case. I know how to organize my time. For a year I studied to be a java developer, went to the 
fitness center, spent time with my children and friends. Also my weakness is English, but I'm working on it, 
devoting every day to learning.

Tell me about your last job 

I worked in one of the largest banks in Russia, as a loan specialist. There were more than 20 people in our team.
My job was to help clients decide what kind of loan they needed, of course it had to be a profitable product for 
the bank) I prepared all the necessary documents. I was engaged in the design. I also want to note that when 
competing with other banks, I managed to be in the lead. I believe that in any work we sell not a product, but the
emissions that the client needs. I think this is my success.

Why have you decided to apply for this position?

My knowledge and desire to develop further in the IT field indicate that I will be able to contribute to the development
of your company as part of a strong team of IT specialists.
